The Easybank Landing Page project is a responsive web page built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It serves as a landing page for a fictional digital banking service called Easybank.

The design is modern and user-friendly, making it suitable for presenting a digital banking service.

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that defines the structure of the landing page.
- `style.css`: The main CSS file that contains the styles for the entire page.
- `reset.css`: A CSS reset file to ensure consistent styling across different browsers.
- `index.js`: The JavaScript file responsible for handling the navigation menu toggle.
